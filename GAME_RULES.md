# Basic rules of MHD Run

## 1. The Basic Concept

This is a two-team game of chase across the city. One team, the **Runners**, must reach a destination and take a selfie. The other team, the **Chasers**, must find and photograph the Runners before they can complete their goal. After a round ends, teams swap roles.

## 2. How a Round Works

**A. Starting the Round**

- A new round begins whenever the Runners are caught or at the very start of the game.
- The Runner team is assigned a random destination, typically 5-6 km away.
- The Runners get a few minutes to plan their strategy.
- The Chasers must give the Runners a 5-minute head start. During this time, Chasers can see the Runners' location and check public transport connections.

**B. The Chase**

- **Runners' Goal**: To reach your assigned destination and take a team selfie before the Chasers photograph you.
- **Chasers' Goal**: To catch the Runners. A "catch" is successful when the Chasers take a single photo where every member of the Runner team is clearly identifiable.
  - The photo must be taken without using zoom.
  - The photo cannot be taken through glass (like a bus window).
- Chasers can track the Runners' live location, unless the Runners use a power-up to disable the tracker.

**C. Ending the Round**

- When the Chasers successfully catch the Runners, the round ends, roles are swapped, and a new round begins.

## 3. How to Win the Game

The game ends in one of two ways:

1.  A team of Runners successfully reaches their destination and takes a selfie.
2.  The overall time limit for the game expires. If this happens, the winning team is the one whose Runners are closest to their target destination.

## 4. Core Rules

- **Stay Together**: Team members must stay together at all times. You cannot split up.
- **Public Transport**: Players may only use the forms of public transport specified in the game's shop.
- **Playing Area**: The game takes place in an area with around 50 evenly distributed target destinations.

## 5. Special Rules for Runners

**A. Money**

- Each Runner team begins the game with 70ðŸª™ in starting capital.
- Any money you have left at the end of a round carries over to the next time you play as Runners.

**B. Cards (Tasks & Curses)**

- **Drawing**: Runners can draw a random card at any time, as long as they don't already have an active one. If you draw a card while on public transport, its effects only begin after you get off.
- **Completing**: To gain a reward or remove a curse, Runners must complete the card's requirements. However, tasks cannot be completed while on public transport or inside an underground metro station.
- **Vetoing & Penalties**:
  - **Tasks** can be vetoed (given up on) at any time.
  - **Curses** cannot be vetoed and must be completed.
  - **Penalty**: If you veto a task or break the rules of a curse, your team is penalized for 4 minutes. During this penalty, you **cannot** use public transport, draw a new card, or buy power-ups. If you are on public transport when you break a curse, you must exit as soon as possible.
